ðŸ”· Arduino Uno R3 CH340G ATmega328P â€“ Development Board Overview
---

âœ… What is it?

The Arduino Uno R3 CH340G is a clone version of the original Arduino Uno R3.
It uses the same ATmega328P microcontroller, but replaces the original ATmega16U2 USB-to-serial converter with a CH340G chip â€” which is cheaper and widely used in clones.
